# BeatSaberNoHealthAndSafety
A plugin to skip the health and safety warning at the beginning of the game.

It works by automatically pressing the "Continue" button after a short delay. It has no configuration or interface.

Do not use this mod if you need the warning in order to stay healthy and safe.

The current version works on 1.7.0 (the current latest version of Beat Saber) and probably also 1.6.1. Old versions exist that work on v1.1.0, as well as v0.13.2, v0.13.0, and v0.12.2

Does not work on v0.13.1
